  an app similar to (not exactly) Minecraft creation mode, UI language is in Chinese. If you have no account, the app can save only one canvas locally in your current browser. After sign in as a certain user, your canvas may be saved on LeanCloud and you can share your canvas to others (not restrict to the users on this site).This is just a demo, please don't spoil the key.
